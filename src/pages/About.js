      <p className='para-text'>DopeLiquor is dedicated to good drinking and great living. We inspire, entertain and educate anyone—and everyone—interested in what happens in the glass and out of it. Cocktail recipes; home bar know-how; bottle recommendations; industry intel and job advice for the bar professional; profiles of the people who matter; the bars and cities to visit—if it centers on the act of drinking and how to live life to the fullest, Liquor.com will tell its story. Our readership is diverse. Everyone from a curious drinker seeking a recipe to a top-tier bar professional researching how to reduce their business’ overhead relies on Liquor.com as a valued resource.
We create entertaining and educational content and experiences that inspire good drinking and great living, as well as educational content and industry experiences that help working bartenders and other trade professionals develop their skills, advance their careers and achieve greater work-life balance.</p>
    
    <h2 className='mt-5'>Editorial Guidelines</h2>
    <p className='para-text'>
    We take our stories, readers and drinking, well, very seriously. All of our articles and recipes are carefully chosen by our editorial team. Liquor.com does not accept payment or any form of kickback for anything we write about. No one can pay to be featured in an article written by Liquor.com. That’s what advertising is for.
    </p>
    <p className='para-text'>
    Liquor.com occasionally sends out emails featuring products or offerings from our sponsors; when paid for, these emails will always be explicitly labeled as “Partner Tip” or “Sponsored.” Likewise, social media content provided by our sponsors is designated by either “(sponsored)” for Facebook or “(sp)” for Twitter. These sponsored emails and posts are one of the ways we keep the lights on around here. They’re how we keep those regular high-quality editorial stories coming.
    </p>
    <p className='para-text'>
    We are committed to helping all people, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, culture, geography, body type, ability or experience. 

We are invested in working with diverse writers, recipe developers, expert sources, illustrators, photographers on-screen talent and more to create, edit and enhance our content—not just on isolated topics of race but across our brands’ coverage.
